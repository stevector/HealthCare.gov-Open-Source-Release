If you’re uninsured, there’s a new way for you to buy health insurance for 2014. It’s called the [Health Insurance Marketplace](/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace/). 

## Getting covered in the Health Insurance Marketplace

No matter where you live, you can use the Marketplace to find a high-quality health plan and enroll to get coverage. With one application you can compare plans based on price, benefits, and other important features before you decide. You’ll also see if you qualify to save money on monthly premiums or out-of-pocket costs—or for free or low-cost health coverage options.

Here are the [key dates](/what-key-dates-do-i-need-to-know/) you need to know: 

- October 1, 2013: Open enrollment in the Marketplace starts
- January 1, 2014: Coverage for Marketplace insurance plans can start 
- March 31, 2014: Open enrollment ends
