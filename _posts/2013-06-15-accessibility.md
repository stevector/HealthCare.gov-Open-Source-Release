# HealthCare.gov Accessibility and Compliance with Section 508
 
HealthCare.gov is committed to making its electronic and information technologies accessible to people with disabilities. We strive to meet or exceed the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended in 1998.
 
Section 508 is a federal law that requires agencies to provide people with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities, unless doing so would impose an undue burden on the agency. The Section 508 standards are the technical requirements and criteria used to determine whether the agency is meeting the requirements of this law.
