- The Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) is a new way to provide insurance for your employees.
- Starting October 1, 2013, you can come here to fill out an application and see your plan choices. In the meantime, we can help you get ready.

## Why should I use the SHOP Marketplace?

### High-quality coverage

All SHOP plans offer your employees a set of comprehensive benefits. 
They cover things like pre-existing conditions, pregnancy, hospitalizations, 
doctor's visits, preventive care, prescriptions, and more.

### Control your coverage and costs

The SHOP makes it easy to discover and compare your insurance options.
You control the coverage you offer and how much you pay toward
employee premiums. And you may qualify for a tax credit worth up to 50%
of your premium costs.
