- The Health Insurance Marketplace is a new way to get coverage that meets your needs.
- Starting October 1, 2013, you can come here to fill out an application and see your plan choices. In the meantime, we can help you get ready.

## Why should I use the Marketplace?

### High-quality coverage

All Marketplace plans offer the same set of comprehensive benefits. They cover things like pre-existing conditions, pregnancy, hospitalizations, prescriptions, doctor’s visits, and more.

### Lower insurance costs

Most people will get some help with costs. You may qualify for lower costs on your  monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs. You may be able to get free or low-cost coverage from Medicaid or CHIP.
