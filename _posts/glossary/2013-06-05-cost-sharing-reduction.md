A discount that lowers the amount you have to pay out-of-pocket for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. You can get this reduction if you get health insurance through the Marketplace, your income is below a certain level, and you choose a health plan from the Silver plan category (See [Health Plan Categories](/glossary/health-plan-categories)). If you're a member of a federally recognized tribe, you may qualify for additional cost-sharing benefits.
