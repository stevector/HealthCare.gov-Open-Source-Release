A program that will provide a health coverage option for you if you have been uninsured for at least six months, you have a pre-existing condition, and you have been denied coverage (or offered insurance without coverage of the pre-existing condition) by a private insurance company. This program will provide coverage until 2014 when you will have access to affordable health insurance choices through the Health Insurance Marketplace, and you can no longer be discriminated against based on a pre-existing condition.
