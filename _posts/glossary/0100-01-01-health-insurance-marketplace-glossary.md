A transparent and competitive health insurance market where individuals, families, and small businesses can learn about their health coverage options, compare health insurance plans based on costs, benefits, and other important features, choose a plan, and enroll in coverage. The Marketplace also includes information on programs that help people pay for coverage, including ways to save on monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and other programs like Medicaid and the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Individuals and families can apply for coverage online, by phone, or with a paper application.
