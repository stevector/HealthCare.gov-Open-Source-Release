The period of time during which individuals who are eligible to enroll in a Qualified Health Plan can enroll in a plan in the Marketplace. For 2014, the Open Enrollment Period is October 1, 2013â€“March 31, 2014. For 2015 and later years, the Open Enrollment Period is October 15 to December 7 of the previous year. Individuals may also qualify for Special Enrollment Periods outside of Open Enrollment if they experience certain events. (See [Special Enrollment Period](/glossary/special-enrollment-period) and [Qualifying Life Event](/glossary/qualifying-life-event))

You can submit an application for health coverage outside of the Marketplace, or apply for Medicaid or CHIP, at any time of the year.
