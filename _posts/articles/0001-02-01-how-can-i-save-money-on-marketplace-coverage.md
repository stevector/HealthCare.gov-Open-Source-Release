When you use the Health Insurance Marketplace you may be able to get lower costs on monthly premiums or out-of-pocket costs, or get free or low-cost coverage. 

You can save money in the Marketplace 3 ways. All of them depend on your income and family size.  

1.	You may be able to [lower costs on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) when you enroll in a private health insurance plan.
2.	You may qualify for lower [out-of-pocket costs](/glossary/out-of-pocket-costs "glossary") for [copayments](/glossary/co-payment "glossary"), [coinsurance](/glossary/co-insurance "glossary"), and [deductibles](/glossary/deductible "glossary").
3.	You or your child may get free or low-cost coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) or the [Children's Health Insurance Program CHIP](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip).

When you fill out your Health Insurance Marketplace application, you'll find out how much you can save. Most people who apply will qualify for lower costs of some kind.
