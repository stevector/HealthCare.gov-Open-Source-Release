The Employer Shared Responsibility Payment applies to some large employers who don't offer insurance that meets certain minimum standards.  

If you have 50 or more full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, you may have to make this payment if: 

* at least 1 of your employees qualifies to save money on monthly premiums in the Marketplace. 

Your employees won't be able to save money on monthly premiums in the Marketplace if the coverage you offer your full-time employees is [affordable](/glossary/affordable-coverage "glossary") and meets [minimum value](/glossary/minimum-value "glossary").  

## How to know if your coverage is affordable
If an employee's share of the premium costs for employee-only coverage is more than 9.5% of their yearly household income, the coverage is not considered affordable. 

Since you typically won't know your employee's household income, you can generally avoid a Shared Responsibility Payment for an employee if the employee's share of the premium for employee-only coverage doesn't exceed 9.5% of their wages for that year as reported on the employee’s W-2 form.

For additional information about this and other safe harbors see [IRS.gov/aca ](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Questions-and-Answers-on-Employer-Shared-Responsibility-Provisions-Under-the-Affordable-Care-Act)

## How to know if your coverage provides minimum value
A health plan meets minimum value if the plan's share of the total costs of covered services is at least 60%. 

**All plans in the Marketplace meet minimum value,** so any coverage offered through SHOP should qualify. 

To determine whether other coverage meets minimum value, you can use the [minimum value calculator]( http://www.cms.gov/cciio/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/index.html#Plan Management) provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. When you input certain information about the plan into the calculator, like [deductibles](/glossary/deductible "glossary") and [copayments](/glossary/co-payment "glossary"), it will help you determine if the plan covers at least 60% of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan.

## Amount of the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment
The amount of the annual Employer Shared Responsibility Payment is based partly on whether you offer insurance. 

* If you **don't** offer insurance, the annual payment is $2000 per full-time employee (excluding the first 30 employees)
* If you **do** offer insurance, but the insurance doesn't meet the minimum requirements, the annual payment is $3000 per full-time employee who qualifies for premium savings in the Marketplace

Unlike employer contributions to employee premiums, the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment is **not** tax deductible.
