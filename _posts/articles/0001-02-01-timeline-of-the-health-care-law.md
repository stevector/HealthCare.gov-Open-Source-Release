## What's Changing
The [Affordable Care Act](/where-can-i-read-the-affordable-care-act) is a set of health insurance reforms that started in 2010 and will continue to roll out in 2014 and beyond. 

2014 is an important year. The [Health Insurance Marketplace](/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace) will offer a new way for people without insurance to get coverage and to find out if they can get [lower costs for private insurance](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums). They can also find out if they qualify for [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) or the [Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip).

Also starting in 2014, people who do not have health coverage may have to pay a [fee](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014/).
