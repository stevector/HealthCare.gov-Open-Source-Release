If your employer offers health insurance through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) for 2014, you'll be able to enroll online. 

## Ask your employer about its health insurance plans

Check with your employer to find out if it will offer health insurance through the SHOP Marketplace or some other coverage for 2014. Ask the person at your job who handles benefits for employees. 

* **If your employer will offer health insurance through the the SHOP Marketplace,** you'll have the option of using the SHOP website to enroll in the coverage selected by your employer. Your employer will give you information you need to enroll. Open enrollment starts October 1, 2013. Coverage starts as soon as January 1, 2014. Employers generally may also start offering SHOP coverage at any time throughout the year. 

## You can choose a plan other than your employerâ€™s 

You do not have to enroll in the health insurance offered by your employer. You can choose to buy other coverage instead. 

But if you buy a plan through the individual Marketplace, you may not qualify for [lower costs on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs). It will depend in part on your income and in part on whether the insurance your employer offers meets certain standards for cost and coverage. Your employer should provide information to help determine whether the plan it offers meets those standards. 

If you choose a plan other than your employer's, your employer does not have to contribute to your premiums. 

## Getting insured in 2014

Starting in 2014, most Americans must maintain health insurance that qualifies as [minimum essential coverage](/glossary/minimum-essential-coverage "glossary") or pay a [fee](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014). Someone enrolled in SHOP health insurance has minimum essential coverage and doesn't pay a fee.
