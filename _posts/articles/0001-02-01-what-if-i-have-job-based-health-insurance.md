If you have job-based health insurance you like, you can keep it. You're considered covered. You may be able to change to Marketplace coverage if you want to.

Any job-based health plan you currently have qualifies as [minimum essential coverage.](/glossary/minimum-essential-coverage "glossary") You don't need to change to a Marketplace plan in order to avoid the [fee](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014) that uninsured people may have to pay for 2014. If you'd like to explore Marketplace coverage options you can, but there are several important things to consider. 

## Comparing job-based and Marketplace plans

With most job-based health insurance plans, your employer pays a portion of your premiums. If you choose a Marketplace plan instead, your employer does not need to make a contribution to your premiums. You should consider this carefully before comparing Marketplace plans.

[Learn more about the Marketplace](/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace).

## Qualifying for Marketplace savings 

If you decide to check out Marketplace plans, be aware that you may not qualify for [lower costs on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) and [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs), even if your income would qualify you otherwise.  

Whether you qualify will depend on what kind of coverage your employer offers. If your job-based coverage is considered [affordable](/glossary/affordable-coverage "glossary") and meets [minimum value](/glossary/minimum-value "glossary"), you won't be able to get lower costs on premiums or out-of-pocket costs in the Marketplace. This is true no matter what your income and family size are.

Your employer can tell you whether the insurance plan it offers meets minimum value and can provide you with information to determine if the plan is considered affordable to you. 

If you do not qualify for lower costs in the Marketplace, and your employer does not pay part of your premiums on the Marketplace, be sure you take these things into account before you consider choosing a plan other than your employerâ€™s.

## Your rights, protections, and benefits 

The health care law provides important new rights, strong consumer protections, and key benefits that apply to most job-based insurance plans.
