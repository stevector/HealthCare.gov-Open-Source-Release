Once you choose SHOP health insurance coverage that works for your business, your employees can sign up for it online through the Marketplace. 

After you choose your health insurance plan, you or the Marketplace will notify your employees and tell them how to sign up. There are tools to help you create an employee roster, set up an employee email distribution list, or download the offer of coverage and distribute it to your employees manually. 

## Steps your employees take to get SHOP health insurance 

Once your employees get the offer, they follow a few steps:

* **Verify their information** to confirm that the name, date of birth, and Social Security information you provided are correct.

* **Provide additional information** like address, contact preferences, tobacco use, and whether they have dependents that need coverage. This information will give them a better idea of what their costs will be.

* **Review the plan** to see if it meets their needs. Your employees can see how much they will pay each month as a premium, what their deductible will be, and how much their total out-of-pocket costs could be. All of these steps can be done directly through the Marketplace.

## Employees decide whether to accept coverage

Next, employees decide whether they want to accept or decline coverage for themselves and their dependents. If they accept the plan, they can view, download, and print a summary of the plan coverage.

Coverage won’t take effect until **you** approve the plan. Once the employee enrollment period is over, you can see who accepted coverage (including dependents if you're offering dependent coverage). You can calculate the total costs to your business and decide if the plan you've chosen works for you. At this point, you can decide to approve the plan or explore other SHOP options.

## What if employees decline the coverage I’m offering?

They can buy coverage in the individual Marketplace or elsewhere. But as long as the coverage you offer is [affordable](/glossary/affordable-coverage "glossary") and meets [minimum value](/glossary/minimum-value "glossary"), you won’t have to make an [Employer Shared Responsibility](/glossary/employer-shared-responsibility-payment "glossary") payment. In addition, your employees won't qualify to save money on monthly premiums or out-of-pocket costs on Marketplace plans. 

You don't have to pay a portion of the premiums of employees who get insurance outside of the plan you're offering.
