If you insure your employees now, you can keep the coverage you have. If you have 50 or fewer full-time employees, you may offer a plan via SHOP instead. 

Beginning in 2014, the small business health care tax credit is available only if you get [coverage through SHOP](/marketplace/shop).

## If your employees buy Marketplace insurance 

Under the law, your employees may buy health coverage through the Marketplace instead of using the coverage you offer.  

As long as the coverage you offer is considered [affordable](/glossary/affordable-coverage "glossary") and meets [minimum value](/glossary/minimum-value "glossary"), employees offered coverage will **not** be eligible for savings on their monthly premiums if they buy through the Marketplace. 

This means you wonâ€™t have to make an Employer Shared Responsibility Payment. [Learn more about the Employer Shared Responsibility Payment.](/what-is-the-employer-shared-responsibility-payment) 

## Changing your coverage to a plan offered through SHOP 

If you want to change your current health coverage to a plan offered through [the SHOP](/what-is-the-shop-marketplace), you can do so.

* Generally, to use SHOP you must be a small business with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees (up to 100 in Hawaii).
* You can apply for coverage starting October 1, 2013 for coverage beginning as early as January 1, 2014. Or you can apply anytime throughout 2014.
