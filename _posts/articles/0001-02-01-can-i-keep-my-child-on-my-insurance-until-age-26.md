If a plan covers children, they can be added or kept on the health insurance policy until they turn 26 years old.

Children can join or remain on a plan even if they are:

* married
* not living with their parents
* attending school
* not financially dependent on their parents
* eligible to enroll in their employer’s plan

## How to get coverage for adult children

Adult child may be enrolled during a plan’s open enrollment period or during other special enrollment opportunities. The employer or insurance company can provide  details.

Under-26-year-olds can be signed up directly in new Marketplace plans. Be sure to include him or her on the list of people to be covered.
