In general, if you have 50 or fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) employees you're considered a small business and may get employee insurance through the [Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP)](/what-is-the-shop-marketplace).

The state of Hawaii allows businesses with up to 100 FTEs to use its SHOP in 2014. Beginning in 2016, all SHOPs will be open to employers with 100 or fewer FTEs.

**If you're self-employed with no employees,** you can buy insurance through the individual [Health Insurance Marketplace](/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace), but not through the SHOP.

Many important parts of the health care law apply to businesses with 50 or more FTEs.
