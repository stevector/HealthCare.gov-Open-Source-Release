If you're enrolled in TRICARE or the Veterans health care program, you're considered covered under the health care law. You don't need to make any changes.

If you’re **not** enrolled in VA benefits or other veterans' health coverage, you can get coverage through the [Health Insurance Marketplace](/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace). You may be able to [get lower costs on monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) and [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs). You may qualify for free or low-cost coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) or the [Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip).

If you don't have coverage in 2014, you may have to pay a [fee.](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014)

## Veterans programs that meet coverage requirements 

If you're enrolled in (or are a beneficiary of) any of the programs listed below, you’re considered to have [minimum essential coverage](/glossary/minimum-essential-coverage "glossary") under the health care law. You don't need to get additional coverage:

* [Veterans health care program](http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/) 
* [TRICARE](http://www.tricare.mil/)
* [VA Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA)]( http://www.va.gov/hac/forbeneficiaries/champva/champva.asp) 
* [Spina bifida health care benefits program]( http://www.va.gov/hac/forbeneficiaries/spina/spina.asp) 

If you're a veteran without VA health care, visit the [VA health care website]( http://www.va.gov/health/default.asp). You may learn that you qualify for VA coverage.  

## If your dependents aren't covered  

If you're a veteran enrolled in (or are a beneficiary of) a VA health care program, your dependents who are **not** eligible for a VA health care program may use the Marketplace to get coverage. They may get [lower costs on monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs). They could be eligible for free or low-cost coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid)or the [Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip).  

Like others, if they don't have health insurance coverage in 2014, they may have to pay a [fee](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014). 

## Note: TRICARE's young adult coverage rules are different from the Affordable Care Act’s version

TRICARE's [young adult coverage option](http://www.tricare.mil/TYA/) is different from the Affordable Care Act's [under-26 rules](/can-i-keep-my-child-on-my-insurance-until-age-26). Eligibility ages, benefits, and other details differ.
