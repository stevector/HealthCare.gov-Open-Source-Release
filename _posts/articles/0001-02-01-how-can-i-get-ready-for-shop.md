If you own a small business, you can prepare to use SHOP now. You can explore your options, gather key information, and get help from a trusted source. 

## Learn about and get ready for SHOP

Open enrollment for SHOP starts October 1, 2013. Coverage for your employees starts as early as January 1, 2014. Small employers can get ready now:  

* Learn about the [SHOP](/what-is-the-shop-marketplace/) Marketplaceâ€”how it works, which businesses qualify, and how using SHOP can benefit you and your employees.
* Get organized with your employee list, health insurance budget, and a target date to start coverage. 
* [Sign up for email updates](/subscribe). We'll keep you informed with the latest news, key deadlines, and other important information about SHOP. 

## Ask your agent or broker about SHOP
[Licensed agents and brokers](/can-i-use-an-agent-or-broker-in-shop/) may be able to help you with your SHOP Marketplace options at no additional cost to you and your employees. You may use your existing broker if you already have one. 

## If you offer coverage, check in with your insurance company
You can find out if your insurance company plans to offer coverage through SHOP, as a [qualified health plan](/glossary/qualified-health-plan "glossary"), and more. 

* If your insurance company isn't offering coverage through SHOP, check with your broker or agent or go to the SHOP website yourself to compare your current plan to options in the SHOP Marketplace.
* Starting in 2014, [small business health insurance tax credits](/will-i-qualify-for-small-business-health-care-tax-credits) are available only through the SHOP. **If you currently get the credit, this is very important to take into account when you make an insurance choice.**

**See this [checklist](/downloads/MarketplaceApp_Checklist12.pdf) of actions you can take now to get ready for SHOP.**
