You may qualify for employer health care tax credits if you have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees making an average of about $50,000 a year or less.

To qualify for the Small Business Health Care Tax Credit, you must pay at least 50% of your full-time employees' premium costs. You donâ€™t need to offer coverage to your part-time employees or to dependents. 

Starting in 2014, the tax credit is worth up to 50% of your contribution toward employees' premium costs (up to 35% for tax-exempt employers). 

**The credit is available only if you get coverage through the SHOP Marketplace.** 

## Higher benefits for smaller businesses

The tax credit is highest for companies with fewer than 10 employees who are paid an average of $25,000 or less. The smaller the business, the bigger the credit. 

## Example of how the tax credit works

Example for an employer who qualifies for the maximum credit worth 50% of their premium contribution in 2014:


**Number of employees:** 		10

**Wages:** 				$250,000 total or $25,000 per employee

**Employer contribution to 
employee premiums:** 		$70,000


**Tax credit amount:**			$35,000 (50% of employer's contribution)
