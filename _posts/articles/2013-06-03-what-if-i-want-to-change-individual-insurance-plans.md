If you have an individual insurance plan and want to change it, you can use the Marketplace to explore your options and enroll in a new plan. 

## Replacing individual insurance 

You may use the Marketplace to replace individual insurance you currently have. In the Marketplace, you can find out whether you can [get lower costs on monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) and reduce your [out-of pocket-costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs). You can compare plans based on price, benefits, and other features important to you. 

Check with your insurance company before cancelling your policy. You may have to wait until the end of your policy year before you can cancel.

## When you can change plans

* If your current plan ends before March 31, 2014, you can use the Marketplace during open enrollment to replace your individual insurance. Starting October 1, 2013, you can enroll for coverage that starts as soon as January 1, 2014. 

* You may qualify for a [special enrollment period](/glossary/special-enrollment-period "glossary") in the Marketplace when your plan ends because you're losing your coverage. See ["What key dates do I need to know?"](/what-key-dates-do-i-need-to-know) for more information about when Marketplace coverage can begin based on when you enroll. 

Your insurance company may need to provide documentation to the Marketplace that your plan has ended.
