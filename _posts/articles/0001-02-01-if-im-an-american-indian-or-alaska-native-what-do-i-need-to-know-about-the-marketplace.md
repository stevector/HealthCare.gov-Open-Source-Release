As a member of a [federally recognized tribe](/glossary/federally-recognized-tribe "glossary"), you have certain protections in the Marketplace starting in 2014. 

* You don't have to pay a fee if you don’t have health coverage.
* You more easily qualify for [lower out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs) for [deductibles](/glossary/deductible "glossary"), [copayments](/glossary/co-payment "glossary"), and [coinsurance](/glossary/co-insurance "glossary").
* You get monthly special enrollment periods allowing you to get insurance outside the yearly open enrollment period 
* You have special cost and eligibility rules for [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) and the [Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip).

If you enroll in a health insurance plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can still get (or keep getting) services from the Indian Health Service, tribal health programs, or urban Indian health programs.

## Special Marketplace benefits 

If you're a member of a [federally recognized tribe](/glossary/federally-recognized-tribe "glossary") and qualify for a health insurance plan in the Marketplace, you have certain protections like:

* Monthly special enrollment periods
* No [copayments](/glossary/co-payment "glossary") or other cost-sharing if your yearly income is below a certain level—around $70,650 for a family of 4 in 2013 ($88,320 for the same family in Alaska).
When you fill out a Marketplace application, you'll find out if you qualify for these lower costs.
* If you qualify for [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) or the [Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip) - and you're eligible for or have gotten services from the Indian Health Service, tribal health programs, or urban Indian health programs--you won't have to pay Medicaid or CHIP premiums, enrollment fees, and out-of-pocket costs. Indian trust income isn’t counted when determining Medicaid eligibility.  

## Proof of tribal membership and Indian income

To get special Marketplace protections, you'll need to provide a copy of a document issued by a federally recognized tribe that shows membership in that tribe. 

If you're applying for Marketplace coverage, in addition to basic information about household size and income, you’ll need to provide information about income from Indian trust land, natural resources, and items of cultural significance. This income won’t be counted for Medicaid or CHIP eligibility, but may be counted for Marketplace purposes.
