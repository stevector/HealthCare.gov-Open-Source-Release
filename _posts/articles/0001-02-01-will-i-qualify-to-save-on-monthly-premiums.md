When you get health insurance coverage in the Marketplace, you may be able to get lower costs on monthly premiums. This depends on your income and family size.

## Pay lower costs for premiums each month
In the Health Insurance Marketplace you may be able to lower the costs of your health insurance coverage by paying lower monthly premiums. You'll see the amount of savings you’re eligible for when you fill out your Marketplace application. Prices shown for insurance plans will reflect the lower costs.

These lower costs are accomplished with a tax credit called the [Advance Premium Tax Credit](/glossary/premium-tax-credit "glossary"). But they can be applied directly to your monthly premiums, so you get the lower costs immediately. 

## Savings depends on income and family size 
The amount you save depends on your family size and how much money your family earns. In general, people at the following income levels will qualify to save in 2014. The lower your income, the higher your savings will be. 
(The amounts below are based on 2013 numbers and are likely to be slightly higher in 2014.)

* Up to $45,960 for individuals
* Up to $62,040 for a family of 2
* Up to $78,120 for a family of 3
* Up to $94,200 for a family of 4
* Up to $110,280 for a family of 5
* Up to $126,360 for a family of 6
* Up to $142,440 for a family of 7
* Up to $158,520 for a family of 8

You may also be able to get [lower out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs), depending on your income and family size. 

## You may be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP
Some people applying for coverage in the Health Insurance Marketplace will be eligible for free or low-cost coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) and the [Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip). You’ll learn if you qualify when you fill out a Marketplace application. 

## Double-check your income
When you apply for coverage in the Marketplace, it's important to double-check the information you put on your application. If the amount of your expected 2014 income you report isn’t accurate, you may not get the right amount of savings. If you wind up making more money than you predicted on your application, you could have to pay back some or all of the savings you’ve received. You would do this on your next tax return. 

## Appealing your cost decision 
If you think we made a mistake when you get your savings decision in the Marketplace, you have the right to appeal. The Marketplace application will explain how to do this.
