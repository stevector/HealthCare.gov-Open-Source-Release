You can apply for health coverage, compare all your options, and enroll in a plan in one streamlined application through the Marketplace.

When open enrollment begins October 1, 2013, you can go to the [Marketplace](/marketplace/individual) and see the health coverage options available to you. Then you can compare plans side-by-side and choose a plan that meets your needs and fits your budget.

## Get health coverage in 4 steps

1. **Set up an account.** You'll provide some basic information to get started, like your name, address, and email address. [Sign up for Marketplace emails now](/subscribe) and we’ll let you know when you can set up a Marketplace account. We'll also keep you up-to-date on other key information. 
2. **Fill out the online application.** You'll provide information about you and your family, like income, household size, current health coverage information, and more. This will help the Marketplace find options that meet your needs. 
3. **Compare your options.** You'll be able to see all the options you qualify for, including private insurance plans and free and low-cost coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) and the [Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip). The Marketplace will tell you if you qualify for [lower costs on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) and [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs) on [deductibles](/glossary/deductible "glossary"), [copayments](/glossary/co-payment "glossary"), and [coinsurance](/glossary/co-insurance "glossary"). You’ll see details on costs and benefits before you choose a plan. 
4. **Enroll.** After you choose a plan, you can enroll online and decide how you pay your premiums to your insurance company. If you or a member of your family qualify for Medicaid or CHIP, a representative will contact you to enroll.
If you have any questions, there’s plenty of live and online [help](/help-center) along the way.
