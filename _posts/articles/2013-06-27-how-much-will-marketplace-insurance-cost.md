Prices of Marketplace plans have not been set yet. Prices will be available October 1, 2013, when open enrollment starts and you can begin shopping.

## How Marketplace health plans will be priced

All insurance plans available through the Marketplace will be offered by private insurance companies. They will decide which plans to offer and how much each will cost.

Starting in October, when you use the Marketplace to compare plans you’ll see prices for all plans available to you. Prices will show any [cost savings you may be eligible for based on your income](/how-can-i-save-money-on-marketplace-coverage). These lower costs are available only in the Marketplace.  

## A range of prices and plans will be available

Some Marketplace health plans will have lower monthly premiums and may charge you more out-of-pocket when you need care. Some will be higher-premium plans that cover more of your costs when you need care. Others will fall in between. All plans will cover the same list of essential health benefits.

Learn more about the [categories of health insurance plans that will be offered in the Marketplace](/how-do-i-choose-marketplace-insurance).

## Lower costs based on income are available only from the Marketplace

It’s important to remember that the only way to get lower costs for health insurance based on your income is through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Depending on your income, you may qualify for lower costs on your monthly premiums or out-of-pocket costs.

You’ll learn whether you are eligible for lower costs when you complete your application after October 1.

In the meantime, you can [answer a few quick questions](/quick-answers#step-1) and find out if you may be eligible for lower costs based on your income.

The result we provide tells you only whether you might qualify for lower costs based on your estimate of your income in 2014. It does not tell you how much a plan would cost you or how much you would save.
