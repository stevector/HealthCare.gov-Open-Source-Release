Starting in 2014, all health plans must offer essential health benefits. But the only way to get lower costs based on income is through the Marketplace.

## All plans will offer essential health benefits

Starting in 2014, no matter how you buy your health insurance—through the Marketplace, directly from an insurance company, or with the help of an agent or broker--all plans for individuals and small groups must cover the same set of [essential health benefits](/what-does-marketplace-health-insurance-cover). They include doctor’s visits, hospital stays, preventive services, prescription drugs, mental health, and other categories of coverage.

Plans will not be able to charge you more or refuse to cover you if you have a [pre-existing condition](/what-if-i-have-a-pre-existing-health-condition). Most plans also must offer the consumer [rights and protections](/how-does-the-health-care-law-protect-me) provided under the health care law.

## Only Marketplace plans offer lower costs based on income

When you apply for Marketplace coverage as early as October 1, 2013, you’ll find out whether you qualify for lower costs on your premiums or out-of-pocket costs. These savings are based on your household income and size.

In 2014, an individual making up to about $45,000, or a family of 4 making up to about $94,000, may qualify for these lower costs. Learn more about [income levels that qualify for lower costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums).

**If you buy a plan outside the Marketplace, you will not be eligible for these lower costs based on your income.**
