If you need coverage, you can use the Marketplace. If you have coverage, you gain new protections. If you don’t have coverage, you may have to pay a fee.
 
## The Marketplace and what’s changing in 2014

Whether you’re uninsured, you’ve been denied coverage in the past, or you just want to explore new options, the Health Insurance Marketplace will give you more choice and control over your health coverage. [The Marketplace will operate in all states](/what-is-the-marketplace-in-my-state), so no matter where you live you’ll have access to coverage. 

In the Marketplace, you can compare coverage options based on price, benefits, quality, and other features important to you. You can choose the combination of price and benefits that fits your budget and meets your needs.

* **You can get lower costs on coverage:** The Marketplace application will tell you if you’re eligible for a [new way to get lower costs on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs) for private insurance. You’ll also learn if you can get free or low-cost coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) or the [Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip).
 
* **Essential health benefits are covered in the Marketplace:** All plans must offer a comprehensive set of [essential health benefits](/glossary/essential-health-benefits "glossary") including doctor visits, preventive care, hospitalization, prescriptions, and more.

* **Pre-existing conditions will be covered:** Plans won’t be able to deny you coverage or charge you more due to [pre-existing health conditions](/what-if-i-have-a-pre-existing-health-condition), including a pregnancy or disability.

* **You can get help in your area:** If you need help finding a plan, several kinds of [help](/help-center) will be available to give you personalized assistance with the process.

* **Fees begin:** Beginning 2014, most people are required to have health coverage. If they don’t, they may have to pay a [fee.](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014) 

Open enrollment for Marketplace plans begins October 1, 2013. Coverage begins as early as January 1, 2014. [Find out how you can get ready now](/how-can-i-get-ready-to-enroll-in-the-marketplace).
