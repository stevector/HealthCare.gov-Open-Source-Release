Starting in 2014, most health insurance plans can't refuse to cover you or charge you more just because you have a pre-existing health condition.

## Being sick doesn't keep you from getting coverage

Starting in 2014, being sick won't keep you from getting health coverage. An insurance company can't turn you down or charge you more because of your condition. You can apply for Health Insurance Marketplace insurance when open enrollment starts on October 1, 2013. Coverage starts as soon as January 1, 2014.

**Note:** Open enrollment ends on March 31, 2014. Outside of open enrollment, you can't enroll in Marketplace coverage unless you have a [qualifying life event](/glossary/qualifying-life-event "glossary").

Find out [what you can do now to get ready to enroll](/how-can-i-get-ready-to-enroll-in-the-marketplace).

[Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) and the [Children's Health Insurance Program(CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip) also can't refuse to cover you or charge you more because of a health condition.
