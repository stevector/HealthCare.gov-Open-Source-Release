There are 4 categories of Marketplace insurance plans: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The categories help you choose a plan that’s right for you. 

## 4 categories of Marketplace insurance plans

When you compare Marketplace insurance plans, they're put into 4 categories based on how you and the plan can expect to share the costs of care:

* Bronze
* Silver
* Gold
* Platinum

All Marketplace insurance plan categories offer the **same set of [essential health benefits](/glossary/essential-health-benefits "glossary").** The categories do **not** reflect the quality or amount of care the plans provide.

The category you choose affects how much your [premium](/glossary/premium "glossary") costs each month and what portion of the bill you pay for things like hospital visits or prescription medications. It also affects your total [out-of-pocket costs](/glossary/out-of-pocket-costs "glossary") —the total amount you’ll spend for the year if you need lots of care.

*Note:* The Marketplace also offers "catastrophic" plans to people under 30 years old and to some people with very low incomes. [Learn more about catastrophic plans.](/can-i-buy-a-catastrophic-plan) 

## Balancing monthly premiums with out-of-pocket costs

As with all health plans, you'll have to pay a monthly [premium](/glossary/premium "glossary"). But it's also important to know how much you have to pay out-of-pocket for services when you get care. 

* Premiums are usually higher for plans that pay more of your out-of-pocket medical costs when you get care. For example, if you have a Gold plan, you'll likely pay a higher premium, but may have lower costs when you go to the doctor or use another medical service. 

* With a Bronze plan, you'll likely pay a lower premium, but you'll pay a higher share of costs when you get care.  

* Platinum plans will likely have the highest monthly premiums and lowest out-of-pocket costs. The plan will pay more of the costs if you need a lot of medical care.

* **In general, when choosing your health plan, keep this in mind:** the lower the premium, the higher the out-of-pocket costs when you need care; the higher the premium, the lower the out-of-pocket costs when you need care.  

## What to consider when choosing your plan

Think about the health care needs of your household when considering which Marketplace insurance plan to buy.

Do you expect a lot of doctor visits or need regular prescriptions? 

* **If you do,** you may want a Gold or Platinum plan. 

* **If you don't,** you may prefer a Bronze or Silver plan. But keep in mind that if you get in a serious accident or have an unexpected health problem, Bronze and Silver plans will require you to pay more of the costs.
