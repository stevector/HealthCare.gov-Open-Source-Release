Small businesses may get health coverage in the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace. **No employers are required to offer health coverage.**

Starting in 2014, small businesses with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent  (FTE) employees (100 in Hawaii) can use SHOP to offer coverage to their employees. You control the coverage you offer and how much you pay toward premium costs.

[Health coverage through SHOP](/marketplace/shop) starts as soon as January 1, 2014. Open enrollment begins October 1, 2013.

## You have health coverage rights

Starting in 2014, insurance plans:

* Can't turn you down based on the health status of your employees or their dependents, even if they have pre-existing conditions. 

* Can't charge you higher premiums for women, or increase your group's premium for employees with high medical costs. 

These rights do not apply to [grandfathered](/glossary/grandfathered-health-plan "glossary") plans.  

[Contact your State Department of Insurance]( http://www.naic.org/state_web_map.htm) to learn more about your rights.

## You may qualify for tax credits if you offer coverage through SHOP

If you have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees making an average of about $50,000 a year or less, you may qualify for a [small business health care tax credit](/will-i-qualify-for-small-business-health-care-tax-credits).  

* Starting in 2014, the tax credit is worth up to 50% of your contribution toward employee premium costs (up to 35% for tax-exempt employers). This will make the cost of providing health coverage lower.   

* Beginning in 2014, the small business health care tax credit is available only if you get [coverage through SHOP](/marketplace/shop).

## Large employers could face payments

The Employer Shared Responsibility payment is a new requirement under the health care law for some large employers. **It applies only to employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent (FTE) employees that don’t offer coverage or whose coverage doesn’t meet certain minimum standards.**
