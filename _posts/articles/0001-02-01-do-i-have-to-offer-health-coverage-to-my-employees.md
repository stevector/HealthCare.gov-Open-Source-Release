**No employer has to offer coverage.** Some large businesses that don't offer coverage meeting certain standards may have to make a shared responsibility payment.  

As of January 1, 2014:

* **If you have fewer than 50 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees,** you are **not** subject to the [Employer Shared Responsibility](/glossary/employer-shared-responsibility-payment "glossary") parts of the law. You **may** use [SHOP](/what-is-the-shop-marketplace) to offer coverage for your employees. 

* **If you have 50 or more FTEs** you may have to make an [Employer Shared Responsibility Payment](/glossary/employer-shared-responsibility-payment "glossary") if at least 1 of your full-time employees [gets lower costs on their monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) when buying insurance in the Marketplace.
