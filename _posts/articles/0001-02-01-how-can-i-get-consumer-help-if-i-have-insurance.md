Many states offer direct help with problems or questions about health insurance through Consumer Assistance Programs. Other help resources are available too. 

Use the menu below to find contact information for your state's Consumer Assistance Program. If your state doesn't have one, we provide contact information for your state's Department of Insurance, which may be able to answer your questions. 

Whether or not your state has a Consumer Assistance Program, you have [rights and protections](/how-does-the-health-care-law-protect-me/) under the health care law, including the [right to appeal](/how-do-i-appeal-a-health-insurance-companys-decision/) decisions made by your health insurance provider.

If you are covered by a job-based health plan, you can contact the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, at www.askebsa.dol.gov or 1-866-444-3272.
