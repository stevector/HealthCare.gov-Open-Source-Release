If you can't afford any health plan, you can get free or low-cost health and dental care at a nearby community health center.

How much you pay depends on your income. Community health centers are located in both urban and rural areas and provide: 

* prenatal care
* baby shots
* prescription drugs
* general primary care
* specialized care for more serious conditions, including mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS
