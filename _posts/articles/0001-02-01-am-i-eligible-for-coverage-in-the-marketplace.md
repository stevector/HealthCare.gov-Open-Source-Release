Most people will be eligible for health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. 

To be eligible for health coverage through the Marketplace, you:

* must live in the United States
* must be a U.S. citizen or national (or be lawfully present)
* can't be currently incarcerated

## U.S. citizens living outside the U.S.

U.S. citizens living in a foreign country are **not required** to get health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. If you're uninsured and living abroad, you **don't** have to pay the [fee](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014) that other uninsured U.S. citizens may have to pay. 

Generally, health insurance coverage in the Marketplace covers health care provided by doctors, hospitals, and medical services **within the United States.** If you're living abroad, it's important to know this before you consider buying Marketplace insurance. 

## Residents of a U.S. territory

U.S. territories can decide whether to create their own Health Insurance Marketplace or expand Medicaid coverage. **Residents of a U.S. territory aren't eligible to apply for health insurance using the federal or state Marketplace.** 

Check with your territory's government offices to learn about these options.
