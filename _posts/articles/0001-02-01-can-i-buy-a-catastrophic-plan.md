People under 30 and some people with limited incomes may buy what is called a "catastrophic" health plan. It protects you from very high medical costs. 

A catastrophic plan generally requires you to pay **all** of your medical costs up to a certain amount, usually several thousand dollars. Costs for [essential health benefits](/what-does-marketplace-health-insurance-cover) over that are generally paid by the insurance company. 

These policies usually have lower premiums than a comprehensive plan, but cover you only if you need a lot of care. They basically protect you from worst-case scenarios.

## Marketplace catastrophic plans cover prevention

In the Marketplace, catastrophic policies cover 3 primary care visits per year at no cost. They also cover [free preventive benefits](/what-are-my-preventive-care-benefits).

If you have a catastrophic plan in the Marketplace, you can’t get [lower costs on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or on [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs).

## Catastrophic plans for people with limited incomes

People 30 and over with low incomes for whom other insurance is not considered affordable or who have received a [hardship exemption](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014) from the fee may be able to buy these catastrophic plans in the Marketplace. 

## Learn if you qualify in the Marketplace
When you fill out a Marketplace application you'll see catastrophic plans listed as options if you qualify for them. If you don’t qualify for a catastrophic plan, you won’t see them as an option.
