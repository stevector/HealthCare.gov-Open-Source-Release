If your business has 50 or more employees, you are considered a "large business" under the health care law. Several important parts of the law apply to you.   

## Most large employers can’t use the SHOP Marketplace

If you have more than 50 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, you generally won't be able to use the SHOP Marketplace to offer health insurance to them. The exception is in Hawaii, where employers with up to 100 employees may use SHOP.  

Starting in 2016, all SHOPs will be open to employers with up to 100 FTEs.

## The Employer Shared Responsibility Payment 
The Employer Shared Responsibility Payment is a new requirement under the health care law that applies to some larger employers. You may have to make this payment if you have 50 or more full-time equivalent employees and:

* At least 1 of your full-time employees gets [lower costs on their monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) through the Marketplace.
