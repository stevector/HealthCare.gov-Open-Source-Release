You qualify for Medicaid based on income and family size. If you're eligible, you get free or low-cost care and don't need to buy a Marketplace plan. 

## Medicaid basics

Medicaid provides health coverage for some low-income people, families and children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Medicaid programs must follow federal guidelines, but they vary somewhat from state to state. 

## You may qualify for Medicaid - now or in 2014
The rules for Medicaid eligibility are different for each state. Most states offer coverage for adults with children below a certain income level, as well as pregnant women, some seniors, and people with disabilities.
Under the health care law, Medicaid eligibility is expanding in most states. More people than ever will qualify for Medicaid starting in 2014. 

Even if you were told you didn't qualify for Medicaid in the past, you may qualify under the new rules. 

To see if you qualify for Medicaid, do one of these:

* **Visit your state's Medicaid website.** Use the menu below to select your state and you'll be sent to the right page. You can apply right now and find out if you qualify. 

But if you're not eligible now, you may qualify in 2014, when new rules take effect in most states. If you submit an application in October 2013 or later, the state will check the new rules when you apply.

* **Starting October 1, 2013, fill out an application for the Health Insurance Marketplace.** When you finish this application, we'll tell you which programs you and your family qualify for. If it looks like anyone is eligible for Medicaid, we'll let the Medicaid agency know so that your coverage can start right away.

## Medicaid benefits
The benefits covered are different in each state, but certain benefits must be covered by every Medicaid program. Check with your state's program to find out what's covered. 

## Medicaid costs
Medicaid is a program designed to be affordable for everyone who's eligible. Depending on your state's rules, you may have to pay a small part of the cost (like a [copayment](/glossary/co-payment "glossary")) for some medical services.
