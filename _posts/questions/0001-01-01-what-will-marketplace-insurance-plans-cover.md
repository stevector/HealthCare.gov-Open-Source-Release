All plans offered in the Marketplace offer a certain set of benefits. These differ according to your state, but all Marketplace plans in all states offer a basic set of minimum guaranteed benefits. (These are called “Essential Health Benefits.”) The benefits fall into 10 categories:

1. Ambulatory patient services
2. Emergency services
3. Hospitalization
4. Maternity and newborn care
5. Mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment
6. Prescription drugs
7. Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices
8. Laboratory services
9. Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management, and
10. Pediatric services, including oral and vision care
 
Once you complete your Marketplace application, you will find out which specific benefits each plan offers.
