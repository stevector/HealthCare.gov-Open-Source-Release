title: "If I can’t get Medicaid, could my children qualify for Medicaid or CHIP?"

---

Many states have separate [Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip), which provide health benefits for children who don't qualify for Medicaid. (Some children will qualify for Medicaid.) In some states, parents and pregnant women qualify for CHIP coverage too.  

Starting in October, fill out an application for the Marketplace. When you finish this application, we'll tell you which programs you and your family qualify for. If it looks like anyone is eligible for CHIP, we'll let the CHIP agency know so that your coverage can start right away.
