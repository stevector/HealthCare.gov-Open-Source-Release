In many states, at least 70% of employees offered coverage must enroll in order for you to buy insurance through the SHOP. This percentage may be different in your state. The SHOP application will let you know how this rule applies to your state.

* Employees with coverage through another employer plan, Medicare, Medicaid, or the military or veterans programs are **not** included in the calculation.  

* Employees with individual non-group private coverage **are** included in the calculation.

**Example (assuming 70% participation rate required):**      
                 
 You have offered coverage to 14 full-time employees
           - 2 have coverage through a spouse's employer
           - 1 is covered by Medicare
           - 1 is covered by TRICARE
         ** 10 employees count toward the 70% requirement**
 
**At least 7 employees must enroll **

* Starting in the 2013 open enrollment period, if enough of your employees don't enroll through SHOP, you'll have a special enrollment period from November 15, 2013 through December 15, 2013. This period is designed to allow employers who don't meet the required participation threshold to offer a SHOP plan.*
