No. As of January 1, 2014, being a woman is no longer a pre-existing condition.
It will be illegal for health insurance companies to discriminate based on gender. Insurers can vary premiums based only on age, tobacco use, family size, and geography. All other factors such as gender, pre-existing conditions, health, claims history, duration of coverage, occupation, and small employer size and industry can't be used to increase premiums.
