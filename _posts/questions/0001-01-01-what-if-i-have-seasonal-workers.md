title: "What if I have seasonal workers?"

---

Generally, seasonal workers aren't included in the [full-time employee and wage calculation](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Small-Business-Health-Care-Tax-Credit-Questions-and-Answers:-Determining-FTEs-and-Average-Annual-Wages) unless they work for you more than 120 days during the tax year.
