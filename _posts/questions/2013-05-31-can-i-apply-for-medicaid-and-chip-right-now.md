title: "Can I apply for Medicaid and CHIP right now?"

---

Yes. You may qualify for Medicaid now. Visit our [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) page to learn more. If you don't qualify now, your state may be expanding Medicaid in 2014 and you may qualify then. Fill out a Marketplace application starting October 1, 2013 to find out if you'll qualify in 2014.

The [Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip) will not be expanding in 2014. You can find out if you qualify right now.
