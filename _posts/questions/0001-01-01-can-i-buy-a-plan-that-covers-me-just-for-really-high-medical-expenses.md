In some cases, yes. 
People under 30 may buy an [insurance policy that covers only very high medical expenses](/can-i-buy-a-catastrophic-plan). This is sometimes called "catastrophic" coverage. This usually requires you to cover **all** of your medical costs up to a certain point, usually several thousand dollars. Any cost over that is paid by the insurance company. These policies have lower premiums than comprehensive plans but cover you only if you need a lot of care. (In the Marketplace, these policies also cover three primary care visits per year and preventive services at no cost.)

Some people over 30 with low incomes may also be able to buy these "catastrophic" plans in the Marketplace.

In either case, you can find out if you qualify for one of these plans when you complete your Marketplace application.
