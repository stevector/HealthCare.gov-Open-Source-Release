title: "What if my care is urgent and I need a faster decision?"

---

**In urgent situations,** you can request an external review even if you haven't completed all of the health plan's internal appeals processes. You can file an expedited appeal if the timeline for the standard appeal process would seriously jeopardize your life or your ability to regain maximum function. You may file an internal appeal and an external review request at the same time. 
 
A final decision about your appeal must come as quickly as your medical condition requires, and at least within 4 business days after your request is received. This final decision can be delivered verbally, but must be followed by a written notice within 48 hours.
