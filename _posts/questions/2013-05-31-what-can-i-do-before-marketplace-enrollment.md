You currently may be turned down, charged a higher premium, or have benefits excluded because of a pre-existing health condition. 

Coverage for Marketplace plans begins January 1, 2014. These plans can't turn you down, charge you more, or exclude benefits because of your condition. You can apply as early as October 1, 2013.

Until then, the health care law provides some rights and protections to people with pre-existing conditions:

* [Insurance companies generally can't limit or deny benefits to children under age 19 with pre-existing conditions.](/how-does-the-health-care-law-protect-me/#part=3)

* In some states, insurance companies aren't allowed to turn you down due to a protection called [guaranteed issue](/glossary/guaranteed-issue "glossary"). Contact your State Department of Insurance to see if this applies to you.

* You may be eligible for coverage through work – your own job or that of a spouse or parent. If an employer offers coverage, you generally can’t be turned down or charged more due to a pre-existing condition thanks to a protection called [nondiscrimination](/glossary/nondiscrimination "glossary").

* Key dates: Open enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace starts October 1, 2013 and ends March 31, 2014.
