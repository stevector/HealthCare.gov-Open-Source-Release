You may qualify for [lower costs on monthly premiums](/how-can-i-save-money-on-marketplace-coverage) through the Marketplace, based on your income and family size. But if you currently have a health insurance plan through your employer, you may not be able to get those discounts. It will depend on what kind of coverage your employer offers. When open enrollment begins in October, you can complete a Marketplace application to see if you qualify for lower costs on your health insurance.
