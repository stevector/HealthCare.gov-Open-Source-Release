Yes. Plans can lose their grandfathered status if they make certain changes that lower your benefits or increase your costs.

In order to keep their grandfathered status, plans can't:

* Significantly cut or lower coverage
* Raise [coinsurance](/glossary/co-insurance "glossary") of the allowed amount for the service.
* Significantly raise [copayment](/glossary/co-payment "glossary") charges
* Significantly raise [deductibles](/glossary/deductible "glossary")
* Significantly lower employer contributions
* Add or tighten a yearly limit on what the health plan pays
