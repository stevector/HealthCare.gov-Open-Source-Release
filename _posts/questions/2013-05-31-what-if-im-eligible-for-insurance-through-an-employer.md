title: "What if I'm eligible for insurance through an employer?"
lang: en

If you are eligible for job-based coverage that you **haven't** enrolled in, you may have bought an insurance plan yourself. If this is the case, if you change to Marketplace insurance you may not be able to get lower costs on monthly premiums or out-of-pocket costs. 

It will depend in part on whether the insurance your employer offers meets certain standards for cost and coverage. Your employer should provide information to help determine whether the plan meets those standards. The Marketplace will also provide tools that help you determine whether the plan meets the standards.
