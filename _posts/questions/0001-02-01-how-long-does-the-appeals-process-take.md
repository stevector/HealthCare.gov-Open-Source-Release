When you request an internal appeal, your plan must give you its decision within:
* **72 hours** after getting your request when the denial is about urgent care. If it is, you may be able to have the internal appeal and external review take place at the same time.
* **30 days** for denials of non-urgent care you havenâ€™t received yet
* *60 days** for denials of services you have already received
