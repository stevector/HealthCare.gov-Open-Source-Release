If you don't have health coverage at all, you have to pay the full cost of all of your medical expenses. You also have no protection from very high bills. This can mean costs of $50 for a flu shot, or $30,000 for a 3-day hospitalization, or hundreds of thousands of dollars for comprehensive cancer care.

In addition, if you don't have health coverage in 2014 and beyond, you may have to [pay a fee](/glossary/fee "glossary").
