Starting October 1, 2013, if you have 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees  (100 or fewer in Hawaii), you can apply for health coverage through the [Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP)](/what-is-the-shop-marketplace). Coverage starts January 1, 2014. The SHOP is a new program that simplifies the process of buying health coverage for your small business. 

* If you have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees and average salaries of $50,000 or below, you may qualify for a [small business health care tax credit](/will-i-qualify-for-small-business-health-care-tax-credits) worth up to 50% of your premium costs. This credit is available only if you get your insurance through SHOP.
