If your insurer does not meet its MLR for the year, you or your employer will get back some of the premium that was paid. 

You may see the rebate in a number of ways including:

* A rebate check in the mail

* A lump-sum deposit into the same account that was used to pay the premium, if you paid by credit card or debit card

* A direct reduction in your future premium

* Your employer may use one of the above rebate methods, or apply the rebate in a way that benefits employees.

If you or your employer are going to get a rebate, your insurer must provide you with a notice of this by August 1. 

If you have an individual insurance policy, you will receive the rebate directly from your insurer. 

For small group and large group plans, the rebate is usually paid to the employer, which may use one of the above rebate methods, or apply the rebate in a way that benefits employees.
**Note:** The Medical Loss Ratio rebate rules do not apply when an insurer has fewer than 1,000 enrollees in a particular state or market.
