* **New coverage options:** Most insurance plans can no longer deny you coverage or charge you more because you have a disability or [pre-existing health condition](/what-if-i-have-a-pre-existing-health-condition).  

* **Save money:** The health care law expands the [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) program to more Americans, including people with disabilities. Medicaid covers many people with disabilities and some adults under age 65 with modest incomes. Besides free or low-cost coverage through Medicaid, you may also be able to [save money on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs) for private insurance. 

* **Long term care:** State Medicaid programs will also be able to offer additional services to help those who need long-term care at home and in the community. To learn more about programs for people with disabilities, visit [www.acl.gov](http://www.acl.gov).

* **No more limits:** Insurance companies can no longer impose [lifetime dollar limits](/glossary/life-time-limit "glossary") on your coverage. [Yearly limits](/glossary/annual-limit "glossary") generally will be prohibited for plan and policy years starting in 2014.
