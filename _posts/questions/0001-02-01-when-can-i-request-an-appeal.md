title: "When can I request an appeal?"

---

You can request an appeal when a health plan denies payment for a treatment or service. When your plan gets your request it is required to review its own decision. 
 
When your plan denies a claim, it's required to notify you of:
 
* The reason your claim was denied
* Your right to file an internal appeal
* Your right to request an external review if your internal appeal was unsuccessful
* The availability of a Consumer Assistance Program (if your state has one)
