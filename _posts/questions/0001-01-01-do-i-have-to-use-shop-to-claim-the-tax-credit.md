title: "Do I have to use SHOP to claim the tax credit?"

---

Yes, for 2014 and following years. While the tax credit has been open to eligible employers since tax year 2010, starting in 2014 you must [buy coverage through SHOP](/what-is-the-shop-marketplace) to claim the credit. If you currently claim the credit, it's important to take this into account as you make your coverage plans for 2014.
