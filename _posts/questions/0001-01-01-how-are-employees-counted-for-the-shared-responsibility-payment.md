In order to be subject to the Shared Responsibility Payment, you must have at least 50 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, or a mixture of full-time and part-time employees that'Â’s equal to at least 50 full-time employees.

**Two examples:**

1. 100 part-time employees = 50 full-time equivalent employees (or 50 FTEs)

2. 25 full-time employees + 40 part-time employees = 45 full-time equivalent employees (or 45 FTEs)

For calculating the Shared Responsibility payment, a full-time employee works at least 30 hours per week. Part-timers work at least 15 hours per week. The number of employees you have in 2013 will determine whether you'll be considered a large employer for 2014.
