title: "How will I know if I can reach the required enrollment level?"

---

When you apply for SHOP, you'll need to fill out information about your employees in order to get a good cost estimate.  

* To make it easier, you may want to find out from your employees ahead of time if they're interested in health coverage you may offer or whether they already have coverage.  
* This will also give you an idea of how many employees may enroll.  
* You won't know exactly how many employees will enroll until you choose your coverage and contribution amount and offer it to your employees.
