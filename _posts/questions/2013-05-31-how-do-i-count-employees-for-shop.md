The limit on employer size applies to full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, which can include part-time employees. For example, 2 half-time employees equal 1 full-time equivalent employee.  

While part-time employees are considered when determining your eligibility for SHOP, it's still up to you to decide if you want to offer coverage to part-time employees.

**In 2014 and 2015, insurance companies in states that run their own Marketplace can continue to use the state's method of counting full-time employees to determine who's eligible for SHOP. If your state runs its own Marketplace, the application will provide details on how to count employees.** [Learn if your state is running its Marketplace.](/what-is-the-marketplace-in-my-state)
