* Look at the information on your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or on the final denial of the internal appeal by your health plan. It will give you the contact information for the organization that will handle your external review.

* See [this state list](http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/external_appeals.html) maintained by the HHS Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight.
