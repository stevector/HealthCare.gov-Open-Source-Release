title: "How long does an internal appeal take?"

---

* Your internal appeal must be completed within 30 days if your appeal is for a service you haven't received yet.
* Your internal appeals must be completed within 60 days if your appeal is for a service you've already received.
*	At the end of the internal appeals process, your insurance company must provide you with a written decision. If your insurance company still denies you the service or payment for a service, you can ask for an external review. The insurance company's final determination must tell you how to ask for an external review.
