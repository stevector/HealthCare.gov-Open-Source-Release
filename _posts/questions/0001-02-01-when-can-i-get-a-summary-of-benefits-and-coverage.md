title: "When can I get a Summary of Benefits and Coverage?"

---

You have the right to get this summary when shopping for or enrolling in coverage. 

The SBC is available for every plan in the Marketplace. You'll find a link to it on each plan page when you enroll through the website. 

You can also ask for a copy from your insurance company or group health plan at any time. All health plans must provide the SBC to you at important points in the enrollment process, like when you apply for or renew your policy. You can also ask for a copy of the Uniform Glossary to help you understand words used in health coverage and medical care.
