Starting October 1, 2013, you can use the Marketplace website to apply for insurance. You’ll be able to enroll yourself directly through the website, or call a toll-free hotline. Other kinds of [help](/help-center) will be available.

If you’re having difficulty finding a plan that meets your needs and budget, there will be people available in your community to give you personalized help with your choices. These services will be available in October and throughout the open enrollment period. 

Coverage from the Marketplace starts as early as January 1, 2014.
