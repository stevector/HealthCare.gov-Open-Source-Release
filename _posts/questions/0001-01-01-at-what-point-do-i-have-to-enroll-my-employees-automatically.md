If you have over 200 employees** you must provide [automatic health plan enrollment](http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/tr12-01.html) for all full-time employees. This includes any waiting period that's been set by law.  
You must let employees know ahead of time so they can decide whether to opt out of any coverage in which theyÂll be automatically enrolled.
