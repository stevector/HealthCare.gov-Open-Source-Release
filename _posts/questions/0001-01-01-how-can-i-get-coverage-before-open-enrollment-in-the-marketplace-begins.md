Until October 1, 2013, you may be turned down, charged a higher premium, or have benefits excluded due to a pre-existing health condition. Coverage for Marketplace plans, which cannot turn you down, charge you more, or exclude benefits based on your condition, begins January 1, 2014. 
Until then, the health care law provides some rights and protections to people with pre-existing conditions:
* Insurance companies canÂt limit or deny benefits to children under age 19 with pre-existing conditions.
* In some states insurers are not allowed to turn you down thanks to a protection called guaranteed issue. Contact your State Department of Insurance to see if this applies to you.
* You may be eligible for coverage through work Â your own job or that of a spouse or parent. If an employer offers coverage, you generally canÂt be turned down or charged more due to a pre-existing condition thanks to a protection called nondiscrimination.
* You may also be eligible for coverage in other health insurance programs until open enrollment begins in October.
* Key dates: Open enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace begins on October 1, 2013 and ends on March 31, 2014. 
If you have questions about your options, visit the Help Center or use the HealthCare wizard tool.
