Yes. But if the coverage you offer is considered ["affordable"](/glossary/affordable-coverage "glossary") and [meets minimum value](/glossary/minimum-value "glossary"), employees will **not** be eligible for [lower costs on their monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) if they buy through the Marketplace. This means you won't have to make an Employer Shared Responsibility payment for those employees.
