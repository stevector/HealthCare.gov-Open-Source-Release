Yes. These rights apply to all health plans that offer dependent coverage, including [grandfathered](/glossary/grandfathered-health-plan "glossary") plans, whether you get coverage through your employer or buy it yourself. 

But there's one temporary exception: Until 2014, grandfathered group plans that offer dependent coverage don't have to offer it up to age 26 if a young adult is eligible for job-based coverage through their own employer.
