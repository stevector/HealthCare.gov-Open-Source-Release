You can choose to buy individual insurance outside the Marketplaceâ€”directly from an insurance company or with the help of an agent or broker. But you won't have access to [lower costs on your monthly premiums](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or [out-of-pocket costs](/how-can-i-save-money-on-marketplace-coverage) outside the Marketplace. 

**Note:** Not all plans you buy outside the Marketplace meet the health care law's requirements for [minimum essential coverage](/glossary/minimum-essential-coverage "glossary"). That means if you buy one of these plans you could still wind up having to pay the [fee](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014/) that people without insurance coverage may face for 2014 and beyond. Insurance plans must tell you whether they provide minimum essential coverage. 

**All Marketplace plans offer minimum essential coverage.**
