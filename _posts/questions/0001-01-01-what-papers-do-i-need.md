Keep copies of all information related to your claim and the denial. This includes information your insurance company provides to you and information you provide to your insurance company like:

* The Explanation of Benefits forms or letters showing what payment or services were denied
* A copy of the request for an internal appeal that you sent to your insurance company
* Any documents with additional information you sent to the insurance company (like a letter or other information from your doctor)
* A copy of any letter or form you're required to sign, if you choose to have your doctor or anyone else file an appeal for you.
* Notes and dates from any phone conversations you have with your insurance company or your doctor that relate to your appeal. Include the day, time, name, and title of the person you talked to and details about the conversation.
* Keep your original documents and submit copies to your insurance company. Youâ€™ll need to send your insurance company the original request for an internal appeal and your request to have a third party (like your doctor) file your internal appeal for you. Make sure to you keep your own copies of these documents.
