title: "Why do I need health coverage if I get services from the Indian Health Service, a tribal health program, or an urban Indian health program?"

By enrolling in a Marketplace plan or [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) or [CHIP](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip) coverage, federally recognized American Indians and Alaska Natives have greater access to services than a local Indian health clinic might be able to provide. 

In most cases, you can still get care at IHS or your tribal facility, and IHS will get payment from the Marketplace to cover your services.
