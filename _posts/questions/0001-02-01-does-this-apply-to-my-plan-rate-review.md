It depends.

**For Rate Review:** These requirements don't apply to [grandfathered](/glossary/grandfathered-health-plan "glossary") individual and small group health plans. Check your plan's materials or ask your employer or your benefits administrator to find out if your health plan is grandfathered.

**For the 80/20 Rule:** These rights apply to all individual, small group, and large group health plans, whether your plan is grandfathered or not.
