Not necessarily. Many large employers "self-insure." This means they pay the costs of employees' health care directly. Many of them cover the [essential health benefits](/glossary/essential-health-benefits "glossary"). But companies that self-insure **do not** have to provide this package of benefits. Check with your employer to find out if it is self-insured and learn about your covered benefits.
