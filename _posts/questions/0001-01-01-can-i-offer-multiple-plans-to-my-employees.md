As an employer, you can choose from a number of plans from multiple insurance companies in the SHOP. **But once you have selected a plan, in most states your employees will have only that one plan as an option.** In some states in 2014, you can offer multiple plans. When you fill out your SHOP application you'll learn if you can offer one or more plans. In 2015, you will be able to offer multiple plans from all state SHOPs.
