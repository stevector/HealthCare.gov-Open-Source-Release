Yes, as long as you [qualify for a Marketplace health plan](/am-i-eligible-for-coverage-in-the-marketplace). Most uninsured people who aren't eligible for Medicaid can get help with health care costs from the Marketplace, depending on the family's income and if the people who need coverage already have it through a job.
