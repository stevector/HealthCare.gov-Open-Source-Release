The Employer Shared Responsibility payment is calculated different ways and is either $2000 or $3000 per employee per year depending on the circumstance.  You don'Â’t have to make a payment on the first 30 full-time equivalent employees.

There are tax advantages to offering health coverage to your employees, but Shared Responsibility payments are **NOT** tax deductible.

The Internal Revenue Service has more information about the [Employer Shared Responsibility payment](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Questions-and-Answers-on-Employer-Shared-Responsibility-Provisions-Under-the-Affordable-Care-Act).
