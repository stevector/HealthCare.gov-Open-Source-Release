Starting October 1, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program will be directly linked to the Health Insurance Marketplace. This means that once you complete the application you’ll see all the programs you qualify for, including Medicaid and CHIP.

In the meantime, you may qualify for Medicaid or CHIP right now. Find information about the [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) program in your state, or call 1-877-Kids-Now (1-877-543-7669) to learn about CHIP. When you call this number, you’ll be connected to your state's programs. Staff can help you learn whether your children qualify and help you enroll them.
