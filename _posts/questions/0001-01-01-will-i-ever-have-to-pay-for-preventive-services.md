title: "Will I ever have to pay for preventive services?"

---

Maybe. You may have to pay some of the costs for preventive care if:

* You get preventive care from an out-of-network provider
* Your office visit involves more services than preventive care. In that case, you may be billed for the office visit or those other services.
