title: "Are the benefits the same in each state?"

---

Generally, yes. But while all Marketplace plans offer the same general set of benefits, specific benefits may be different in each state. Even within the same state, there can be small differences between plans. When you fill out your Marketplace application and compare plans, you'll see the specific benefits each plan offers.
