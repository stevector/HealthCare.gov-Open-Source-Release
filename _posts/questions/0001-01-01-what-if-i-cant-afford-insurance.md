When you fill out a Marketplace health insurance application, you'll find out whether you can [get lower costs on your monthly premium](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-monthly-premiums) or [out-of-pocket costs](/will-i-qualify-to-save-on-out-of-pocket-costs). This may make insurance more affordable than you think. 

Depending on your income, you may be able to get free or low-cost coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) or the [Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip). Medicaid is expanding in many states in 2014, meaning you may qualify in 2014 even if you haven't qualified in the past. When you apply, the Marketplace will tell you if you qualify under your state's rules.    

In the meantime, you or your child may qualify **now** for free or low cost health coverage through [Medicaid](/do-i-qualify-for-medicaid) and/or [CHIP](/are-my-children-eligible-for-chip). 

When you apply for coverage, the Marketplace will determine whether coverage is affordable for your income level. If coverage is not considered affordable to you, you will not have to pay the [fee](/what-if-someone-doesnt-have-health-coverage-in-2014) that other people who do not have coverage may face.

If you have no insurance, you can [use a community health center](/where-can-i-get-free-or-low-cost-care) in your area to get health care.
