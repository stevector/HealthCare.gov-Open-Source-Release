* **Save money on drugs:** If you're in the prescription drug "donut hole", you'll get more than 50% off when buying Part D-covered brand-name prescription drugs. You save on generics too. [The donut hole will be closed completely by 2020](https://medicare.gov/part-d/costs/coverage-gap/more-drug-savings-in-2020.html).
