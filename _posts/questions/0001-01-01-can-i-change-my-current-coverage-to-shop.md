If you want to change the health coverage you currently offer to a plan offered through the SHOP, you can do so.

* Generally, in order to use SHOP you must be a small business with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) employees (100 in Hawaii).   
* You can apply for coverage starting October 1, 2013 for coverage beginning as soon as January 1, 2014 . Or you can apply anytime throughout 2014.
