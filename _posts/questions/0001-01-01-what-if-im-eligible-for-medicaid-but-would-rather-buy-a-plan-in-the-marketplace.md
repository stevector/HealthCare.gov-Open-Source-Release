title: "What if I'm eligible for Medicaid, but would rather buy a plan in the Marketplace?"

---

If you're eligible for Medicaid, you don't need to buy a plan in the Health Insurance Marketplace. A Marketplace plan will be more expensive than Medicaid and usually won't give you additional coverage or benefits. You wouldn't be eligible for any savings on Marketplace insurance and would have to pay the whole cost.
