title: "What are my rights in an external review?"

---

Insurance companies in all states must participate in an external review process that meets the consumer protection standards of the health care law.  

**State:** Your state may have an external review process that meets or goes beyond these standards. If so, insurance companies in your state will follow your state's external review processes. You'll get all the protections outlined in that process.  

**Federal:** If your state doesn't have an external review process that meets the minimum consumer protection standards, the federal government's Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will oversee an external review process for health insurance companies in your state.   

Depending on your plan and where you live, the following may apply to you:

* Insurance companies may choose to participate in an HHS-administered process or contract with independent review organizations in states where the federal government oversees the process. 
* If youâ€™re in an employer-sponsored health plan, you may not be eligible to participate in a state-run external review process.  
* If your plan doesn't participate in a state or HHS-administered external review process, your health plan must contract with an independent review organization.
