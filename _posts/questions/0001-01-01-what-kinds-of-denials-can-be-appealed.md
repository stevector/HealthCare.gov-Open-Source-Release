title: "What kinds of denials can be appealed?"

---

You can file an internal appeal if your health plan won’t provide or pay some or all of the cost for health care services you believe should be covered. The plan might issue a denial because:

* The benefit isn't offered under your health plan
* Your medical problem began before you joined the plan
* You received health services from a health provider or facility that isn't in your plan's approved network 
* The requested service or treatment is "not medically necessary"
* The requested service or treatment is an "experimental" or "investigative" treatment
* You’re no longer enrolled or eligible to be enrolled in the health plan
* It is revoking or canceling your coverage going back to the date you enrolled because the insurance company claims that you gave false or incomplete information when you applied for coverage.
