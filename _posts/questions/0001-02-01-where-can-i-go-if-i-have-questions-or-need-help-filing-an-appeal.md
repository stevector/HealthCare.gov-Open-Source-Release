* See our quick guide to filing an appeal.

* If you have questions about whether the internal appeals and external review provisions apply to you, ask your health plan or [state insurance regulator](http://www.naic.org/state_web_map.htm).

* Your state may have a health care Consumer Assistance Program that can help you file an appeal or request an external review.
