title: "How do I determine how many employees I have?"

---

In order to qualify for a small business health care tax credit, make sure you have fewer than 25 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, especially if you have a mixture of full-time and part-time employees. 

* Employer size is based on **full-time equivalent** employees and hours of service. An employee's hours of service include each hour the employee is paid or will be paid during the tax year.  

* If you have fewer than 25 FTEs making an average of about $50,000 a year or less, you may qualify for the tax credit.  

For example, an employer who has 46 part-time employees that are paid for 1,040 hours of work in a year, has 23 full-time equivalent employees.
