Eligibility for the tax credit depends on income and family size. You’ll see the amount of tax credit you can get right after you complete your Marketplace application.

When enrollment starts in October, it’s important to double-check your application to make sure everything is accurate. If the amount of income you report isn’t accurate, you may not get the right
amount of tax credit you’re eligible for. This could mean you have to pay back money at the end of the
year.
