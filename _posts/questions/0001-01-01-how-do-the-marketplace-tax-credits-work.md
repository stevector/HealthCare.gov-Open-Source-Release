With most tax credits, you have to wait until you file your income taxes to get the credit. But the Marketplace tax credit lets you reduce your health insurance costs right away.

People who qualify can take the tax credit immediately to lower their monthly health plan premiums
starting in 2014. This can help make insurance more affordable.

Once you enroll in a Marketplace health plan, you can control how much of your tax credit you want to use to help pay your monthly health plan premiums. The tax credit is sent directly to your insurance
company and applied to your premium, so you pay less out of your own pocket.
