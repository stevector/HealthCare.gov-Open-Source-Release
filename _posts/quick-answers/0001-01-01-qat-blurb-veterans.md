Because you’re a veteran, you might be eligible for VA health benefits or coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Find out more about eligibility from the [Veterans Administration website](http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apply/). Whether you’re eligible or not for VA health benefits, you may be able to use the Marketplace to find affordable options.
