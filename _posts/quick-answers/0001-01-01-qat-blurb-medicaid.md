you could be eligible for free or low-cost health coverage through Medicaid, which provides coverage to millions of Americans with limited incomes or disabilities. New rules in many states mean you may qualify in 2014 even if you havenâ€™t qualified before. Your eligibility will depend on your household income and family size.
